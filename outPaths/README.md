# outPaths

This directory is for storing recordings of pure pursuit runs generated by unit tests. You can "play" them back in the visualizer using the gradle task

```
./gradlew ppviz
``` 

or by running `com.team2502.ppsimulator.Main`

You *will* need to run the `SimulatorTest` located in `src/test/java`. This unit test is responsible for creating the 
csv files here, and it will do so whether or not it succeeds.
